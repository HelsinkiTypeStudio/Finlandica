# Finlandica

The official typeface of Finland commissioned by the Prime ministers office and Business Finland for the promotion of Finland.

Its strong and compressed shapes embody a traditional virtue in Finnish culture: honest and resilient determination – “Sisu”.

Ink traps like cuts from a blunt ax, makes the typeface reliable in small sizes and gives it character in large headlines. Like the Finnhorse it’s a breed suitable both as riding horse and workhorse.

In the spirit of “Jokamiehenoikeus” this typeface is Open Source.
