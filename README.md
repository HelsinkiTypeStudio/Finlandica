The official typeface of Finland designed by [Helsinki Type Studio](https://helsinkitypestudio.com).

In the spirit of the Finnish “Jokaisenoikeus” this typeface is Open Source.

The strong and compressed shapes embody a traditional virtue in Finnish culture: honest and resilient determination – “Sisu”.

Ink traps like cuts from a blunt ax, makes the typeface reliable in small sizes and gives it character in large headlines. Like the Finnhorse it’s a breed suitable both as riding horse and workhorse.

The typeface is part of a toolbox of assets for the promotion of Finland and commissioned by the Prime minister's office and Business Finland.
